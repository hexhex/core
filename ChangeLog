2011-07-26  Peter Schueller  <ps@kr.tuwien.ac.at>

	Summary of changes for going from version 1.7.X to version 2.Y:

	Most important changes:

	* Implemented Evaluation formalism with Evaluation Graph and Model Graph as
	described in the paper "Pushing Efficient Evaluation of HEX Programs by Modular
	Decomposition" by Thomas Eiter, Michael Fink, Giovambattista Ianni, Thomas
	Krennwallner, and Peter Schüller at LPNMR 2011.
	Currently implemented evaluation heuristics are "old" (old dlvhex behavior),
	"trivial" (keep all initial evaluation units, causes a lot of overhead), and
	"easy" (try to collapse evaluation units that are related). Heuristics are
	selectable with --heuristics.

	* Implemented incremental model generation (one model at a time).

	* Entities are now managed using 64bit integers (class dlvhex::ID) and an
	entity registry where all constants, rules, ... are registered.

	* Query Support:
	Queries are now supported as an 'internal' plugin (use --query-enable),
	namely ground and nonground queries as in DLV, support for displaying all
	witnesses, and for incremental cautious nonground querying. External atoms
	are currently not supported in queries.

	* Strong Negation is now implemented as an internal plugin and has to be
	activated using --strongnegation-enable (see also strong negation testcases).

	* Higher Order is now implemented as an internal plugin and has to be
	activated using --higherorder-enable (see also higher order testcases).
	Using the higher order mode is discouraged, please formulate your higher order
	programs just as you would formulate any metaprogram, this way the program can
	be much more efficient than an automatic plugin could be. (Higher order mode
	requires strong safety checking to be disabled until a weaker notion of strong
	safety is defined and implemented.)

	Plugin API changes:

	* Plugins must now return PluginAtomPtrs/PluginConverterPtrs/... that use
	a "deleter" compiled into the respective plugin (see PluginInterface.h)
	* New central auxiliary constant management method in Registry:
	getAuxiliaryConstantSymbol(), PluginAtom no longer manages its auxiliaries.
	* added comfortable "text-only no-registry-ID-trouble" (and slow) plugin
	interface ComfortPluginInterface.hpp.
	* Plugins may now provide an alternative HEX parser by overriding createParser().
	* Plugins may now extend the HEX parser using parser modules.
	* Plugins may now register "auxiliary printer callbacks" for printing certain auxiliaries.

	Testing and debugging additions:

	* New Logger component with log-levels, hierarchical indentation and
	NDEBUG-dependent logging.
	* Printhelpers.hpp utilities for comfortable printing of various boost
	and STL containers.
	* testsuite/run-dlvhex-tests.sh: Added possibility for negative testcases.
	(See comments in trunk/run-dlvhex-tests.sh for some documentation.)
	* testsuite/answerset_compare.py: New script for real set-comparison for
	verifying answer-sets (previously the order of answer sets mattered).
	* src/dlvhex/gdbdlvhex.sh: Added shellscript to use gdb with
	libtool-built uninstalled binary.
	* src/dlvhex/valgrinddlvhex.sh: Likewise for valgrind.
	* New testcase notwellfounded2.hex for guess and check model builder
	(should test minimality of disjunctions, this test crashes dlvhex trunk/)

	Other (smaller) additions:

	* Prototype support for clingo as backend ASP solver (aggregates and some
	builtins probably do not work correctly yet - please file a Trac issue or
	drop the maintainers an email if you need some feature).
	* Added static linking test for testsuite TestPlugin.
	* Added commandline option for keeping auxiliary predicates in output.
	* Added commandline option for omitting EDB facts from output.
	* Added commandline option for configuring graphviz output. (Eval/model
	graph are not yet fully implemented but partially exists in testcases.)
	* External atoms may now appear in aggregates (this was partially
	forbidden and incorrectly implemented for the other cases in dlvhex
	1.x), see also new testcase examples/agg3.hex.
	* Added central auxiliary constant management method to Registry:
	getAuxiliaryConstantSymbol(), PluginAtom no longer manages its auxiliaries.
	* State machine for dlvhex implementation now features states that may be
	implicitly skipped (= optional states).
	* Prefixing --plugindir argument with ! resets the search path (also de-
	activating LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the plugin library search).

	Temporarily removed functionality:

	* removed RuleMLOutputBuilder as it was a hack, most probably no longer
	works correctly, and can (and should) be realized as a plugin.
	* removed --dlt option as it can (and should) be realized as a plugin.
	* Predicate inputs of external atoms no longer may be variables, this was
	possible in dlvhex 1.x but it was incorrectly implemented (see example
	variable_input_predicates.hex example in trunk/) and we need a new
	implementation strategy for doing that. This change causes the changes to
	extatom5.hex and extatom6.hex testcases.
	* Weak constraints are currenty not implemented, as there are plans to
	implement them in a more efficient way than previously done. Therefore
	weak testcases have been deactivated:
	../weak1.hex weak1.out -a
	../weak1.hex weak1r.out -ra
	../weak2.hex weak2.out -a
	../msp.hex msp.out -a
	* Namespaces are currently not implemented, as they will be implemented
	as a plugin. Therefore namespace testcases have been deactivated:
	../namespace1.hex namespace1.out
	../namespace2.hex namespace2.out

	Removed functionality:

	* removed --reverse option as it was not implemented and not documented.

	Internal structural changes:

	* Class Globals was renamed to Configuration and is no longer a
	singleton (each ProgramCtx may have its own config if dlvhex is used as a
	library).
	* Input sources (including URL inputs) are now encapsulated in the
	InputProvider objects.
	* Class PluginContainer is no longer a singleton as API users might have
	different programs with different plugin containers.
	* The testsuite no longer uses CPPUnit, it now uses the boost
	unit-testing framework (boost UTF).
	* The testsuite was moved from src/dlvhex/testsuite/ to testsuite/.
	* Plugins must now return PluginAtomPtrs/PluginConverterPtrs/... that use
	a "deleter" compiled into the respective plugin (see PluginInterface.h)
	* No longer using -nofact for external dlv solver because we sometimes
	need to keep facts and we never want derived facts that are present in
	the EDB to "reappear".
