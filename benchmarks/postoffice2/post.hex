% Post office problem
%
% A set of locations (towns, villages) L is to be partitioned into a number of postal regions R; each region is assigned a postal (zip) code and a post office. The number of available postal codes resp. offices is limited.
% As side constraints, locations have a certain distance to each post office and the distance to the assigned post office may not be larger than a given value. Moreover, the number of locations belonging to the same region is limited due maximum capacities of post offices.

% assign each location to a post office
% assign each location to a post office
assign(L, R) :- not nassign(L, R), possible(L, R).
nassign(L, R) :- not assign(L, R), possible(L, R).
assigned(L) :- assign(L, R).
:- location(L), not assigned(L).
:- assign(L, R1), assign(L, R2), R1 != R2.

% locations can only be assigned to regions that are not too far away
possible(L,R) :- location(L), region(R), distance(L,R,D), maxDist(R, M), D < M.

% check capacities of post offices
:- &getSizesRestr[assign,possible](R, S), maxSize(R, M), S > M.
