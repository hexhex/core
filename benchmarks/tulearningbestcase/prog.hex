% monolithic: grounding problem because external atoms are evaluated under exponentially many interpretations
% splitting: solving problem because constraint at the bottom cannot eliminate guesses

dom(X) :- #int(X).

% the following rules let the greedy heuristics split before the main part (since the external atom is nonmonotonic)
in(X) v out(X) :- #int(X).
someIn :- in(X).

% main part
res(X) :- &testSetMinusNogoodBasedLearning[dom,in](X)<tuplelevellinear>.
:- res(X), someIn.
