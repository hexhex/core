%% If S' = S then spoil.
%% Use the sucessor function and check starting from supremum whether
%% elements in S' is also in S. If this is not the case we "stop"
%% If we reach the supremum we spoil up.

% eq indicates whether a guess for S' is equal to the guess for S
eq_upto(Y) :- inf(Y), in(Y), inN(Y).
