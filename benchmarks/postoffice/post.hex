% Post office problem
%
% A set of locations (towns, villages) L is to be partitioned into a number of postal regions R; each region is assigned a postal (zip) code and a post office. The number of available postal codes resp. offices is limited.
% As side constraints, locations in a region must be connected, and the number of locations belonging to the same region is limited due maximum capacities of post offices.

% assign each location to a post office
assign(L, R) : region(R) :- location(L).

% regions must be connected
adjacent(L2, L1) :- adjacent(L1, L2).
path(L1, L2) :- adjacent(L1, L2), assign(L1, R), assign(L2, R).
path(L1, L3) :- path(L1, L2), path(L2, L3), assign(L1, R), assign(L2, R).
:- assign(L1, R), assign(L2, R), L1 != L2, not path(L1, L2).

% check capacities of post offices
%sizes(R, S) :- &getSizes[assign](R, S).
:- &getSizes[assign](R, S), maxSize(R, M), S > M.
