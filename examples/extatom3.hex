% domain predicate, keeps the NAF-rules in_ww, out_ww, and p_ww safe
dom(d1).
dom(d2).

% X is either in_ww/1 or out_ww/1
in_ww(X)      :- dom(X), not out_ww(X).
out_ww(X)     :- dom(X), not  in_ww(X).

% testA is true for "foo" if interpretation is empty, otherwise it is true for "bar"
% -> p_ww is false for all values of X as dom is not true for foo or bar
p_ww(X)       :- &testA[dl_pc_2](X), not &testA[dl_pc_1](X), dom(X).

% input to the extatoms
% as p_ww is not true for anything (see above), dl_pc_2 is not true for anything
dl_pc_2(ww,X) :-  p_ww(X).
% dl_pc_1 is true for everything in_ww is true for (either d_1 or d_2 or both or nothing)
dl_pc_1(ww,X) :- in_ww(X).

% so far the program is consistent with all guesses surviving

% testA is never true for something in dom, therefore the following kills all
% answer sets where something is in_www
fail :- in_ww(X), not &testA[dl_pc_2](X), not fail.

% these constraints never get active as testA only outputs foo or bar in X
% nevertheless the constraints are in the program as they may confuse evaluation heuristics
% (and have repeatedly done so)
fail :- out_ww(X), &testA[dl_pc_1](X), not fail.
fail :- out_ww(X), &testA[dl_pc_2](X), not fail.
