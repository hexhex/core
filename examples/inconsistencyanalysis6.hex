% Generating a production plan.
%
% A sets S of produced products implies certain requirements r(S). We assume that this function is *nonmonotonic*, i.e.,
% production of additional products may eliminate requirements because one might uses the additionally produced items or by-products as a replacement for the former requirement.
% Example: The production of a device may require a supplier for CPUs, but if CPUs are also produced in-house, then this supplier is not needed anymore.
% Moreover, the need for a certain requirement depends only on a small subset of the produced or not produced products.
%
% We have constraints which forbid certain combinations of requirements because we cannot acquire them. We want the compute the possible production plans.
%
% Formally:
% Given a set of possible products to produce P={P1, ..., Pn}, a set of requirements R = {R1, ..., Rn}, a requirements function r: 2^P -> 2^R and a set C \subseteq 2^R of constraints.
% Find a production plan L \subseteq P s.t. C' \not\subseteq r(L) for all C' \in C.
%
% The computation of the requirements is realized as an external atom, which is
% (i) nonmonotonic
% (ii) depends only on a small part of the input (usually).
% The requirement checks follow after the evaluation of the external atom. Without transunitpropagation, the checking part is completely separated from the guessing part.
% The external source support partial evaluation. For any Ri, the external source returns T (F) if Ri is a requirement of all (no) completions of the partial product plan, and U otherwise.

product(X) :- #int(X).

% guessing part
produce(X) v nproduce(X) :- product(X).

% define requirements of products (actually considered as part of the external source, but are implemented as fact to allow for easier modification -> influence on runtime is negnectible).
require(a,p,1,2,3,n,4).
require(a,p,4,n,5).

% checking part is split from the guessing part due to the (possibly) non-monotonic external atom
requirement(Z) :- &getreq[produce,require](Z).
:- requirement(Z), requirement(W), Z != W.
