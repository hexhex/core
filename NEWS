** Support for choice rules.
** Support aggregates with multi-component symbolic sets.
** dlvhex is now compliant with ASP-Core-2 standard.
** Code cleanup, bugfixes and stability improvements, improved error and warning messages.
** New default options: strong negation, liberal safety and external learning methods are enabled by default (increased efficiency, decreased syntactic restrictions).
** Complete doxygen documentation.
** The solver backend was upgraded to clasp 3.1.1.

* Version 2.4.0 (September 2014)

** A new interface which support plugins to be implemented in Python.
** An alternative algorithm for external source compatibility checking based on support sets.
** A plugin interface for customized model generators.
** Numerous bugfixes and optimizations.
** The solver backend was upgraded to gringo 4.4.0 clasp 3.1.0.

* Version 2.3.0 (December 2013)

** Various performance improvements and bugfixes.
** Fine-tuning of heuristics.
** See Changelog for minor changes and more details.

* Version 2.2.0 (August 2013)

** Support for function symbols (see examples/functionsymbols<N>.hex)
** Existentials in the head (see examples/exists<N>.hex)
** Liberal safety (see examples/liberalsafety<N>.hex)
** Various performance improvements and bugfixes.
** See Changelog for minor changes and more details.

* Version 2.1.0 (October 2012)

** Gringo+Clasp can now be built as part of the dlvhex build process and
   can be automatically integrated into dlvhex as default solver backend.
** New method for computing FLP semantics using Unfounded Set Checks
** New evaluation heuristics for more efficient solving using the conflict-
   driven solver backends (genuineii, genuinegc).
** See Changelog for minor changes and more details.

* Version 2.0.0 (March 2012)

** Rewrite of evaluation and decomposition framework, see the paper
   "Pushing Efficient Evaluation of HEX Programs by Modular Decomposition"
   by Thomas Eiter, Michael Fink, Giovambattista Ianni, Thomas
   Krennwallner, and Peter Schüller (LPNMR 2011).
** Rewrite of entity management (IDs plus Registry instead of strings).
** Extend Plugin API: ComfortPluginAtom parallel to PluginAtom.
** Add incremental model building (one model at a time).
** Add Plugin Versioniong ABI.
** Add interface for input parser modules.
** Add ASP querying support (brave, cautious, ground, nonground).
** Add multithreaded support.
** Add support for input-call stratified modular nonmonotonic logic programs (MLPs).
** Various fixes, improvements, and new testcases.
** See ChangeLog for more details.


* Version 1.7.2 (October 2010)

** Fix configuration error with boost 1.44.


* Version 1.7.1 (July 2010)

** Fix dlvdb support in libaspsolver.

** Introduce better benchmarking support.

** Code clean-ups and beautifications.

** Improve speed of answer set parser.

** Fix tickets #7, #11, #12, #13, #14. 


* Version 1.7.0 (June 2010)

** This is the last dlvhex release with major number 1 and minor number 7.

** Add support for dlvdb as ASP solver (--solver=dlvdb).

** Introduce dlvhex namespace.

** Introduce OutputBuilder interface, which allows plugins to have their own output formats.

** Sanitize Plugin interface.

** Use libltdl for loading the plugins.

** Add support for retrieving HEX-programs via HTTP (or whatever protocol libcurl supports).

** Use a more efficient replacement name technique for external atoms.

** Add support for a simple caching strategy for external atoms (turn off with --nocache).

** Support for nonmonotonic external atoms (instantiate your external atom with PluginAtom(false)).

** Install libdlvhexbase.so and libaspsolver.so in $libdir instead of $pkglibdir (e.g., instead of /usr/local/lib/dlvhex, they are now located in /usr/local/lib).

** Use singleton interface for the name tables, caused a nasty bug with duplicate global Term::names instantiations.

** Fix ticket #1.


* Version 1.6.0 (August 2007)

** Variable arities of external atom input lists.

** Debugged model-generation algorithm.

** Added switch --reverse for reverse ordering of weak constrained models.

** Added GPL license.

** Improved documentation.
