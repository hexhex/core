DLVHEX Core
===========

This file provides some hints how to install and run dlvhex.

* You just want to use the binary
  We provide pre-compiled Debian/Ubuntu packages of dlvhex and its
  plugins at <https://launchpad.net/~tkren/+archive/asp>. Just run

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tkren/asp

  and then you can install dlvhex and the plugins using your favorite
  package management tool.

* You want to build and install from source
  dlvhex uses the standard

  $ ./configure && make && make install

  approach for installation. In any case, you probably need to install
  additional packages to satisfy all required software dependencies.

** Dependencies
*** DLV
    dlvhex uses the answer-set solver DLV, which can be downloaded
    from <http://www.dlvsystem.com/>. Put the downloaded binary in
    your path so that it is executable on your system (don't forget to
    "chmod +x" it!).  dlvhex is looking for `dlv', so you might want
    to rename the downloaded binary or create a softlink to it.
*** libgringo / libclasp
    You can use libgringo / libclasp to use them as genuine grounder resp. solver.

    You might want to use the script checkout_build_potassco.sh in this package
    to prepare gringo and clasp libraries to be used by dlvhex.

    If something fails, see the following information.

    Use the configure option
    `--with-libgringo=<gringo-trunk-dir>' resp.
    `--with-libclasp=<clasp-trunk-dir>' to specify the directory
    where you have built clingo-app resp. clasp.app.

    IMPORTANT:
    - use the same boost library as dlvhex, 1.43 works for us
    - you might need to hack CMakeLists.txt to accept your boost version
    - CMakeLists.txt should be modified to force the usage of multithreaded boost
      (change OFF to ON in the respective line) because dlvhex requires multithreaded boost libraries
*** libclingo
    Alternatively, you can use libclingo as background model
    builder. Use the configure option
    `--with-libclingo=<gringo-trunk-dir>' to specify the directory
    where you have built clingo-app.

    How to build a working clingo-app:
    - checkout 3.0.4 tag of gringo
      $ svn co https://potassco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/potassco/tags/gringo-3.0.4
      $ cd gringo-3.0.4
    - create release directory
      $ mkdir -p build/release
    - cmake (specify your boost root)
      $ BOOST_ROOT=<yourboost> cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-Wall -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
    - make (specify your boost root)
      $ BOOST_ROOT=<yourboost> make clingo-app

    Now configure dlvhex with

    $ ./configure --with-libclingo=/path/to/gringo-3.0.4

    IMPORTANT:
    - use the same boost library as dlvhex, 1.43 works for us
    - you might need to hack CMakeLists.txt to accept your boost version

    There is also a script which does everything automatically: checkout_build_potassco.sh
*** DLVDB
    FIXME
*** libdlv
    currently unsupported
*** boost
    Boost is a collection of portable C++ source libraries, which are
    intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum
    of applications. You will need a version >= 1.41. See
    <http://www.boost.org/>.

    dlvhex needs the following Boost libraries:
    Boost.Graph
    Boost.Iostreams
    Boost.Smart_Ptr
    Boost.Spirit
    Boost.String_Algo
    Boost.Tokenizer
    Boost.Thread
    Boost.UnitTestFramework

    Popular Linux and Unix distributions such as Fedora, Debian, and
    NetBSD include pre-built Boost packages. E.g., in Debian/Ubuntu
    just run

    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

    or

    $ sudo apt-get install libboostN.NN-all-dev

    for boost version N.NN.

    If your Debian/Ubuntu system did not provide recent boost
    packages, have a look at
    <https://launchpad.net/~boost-latest/+archive/ppa>.

    Installation instructions are given in the INSTALL file found in
    the boost distributions tarball. In order to install
    boost-iostream, install libbz2-dev. Here is a quick-start guide
    for compiling boost (if you have multiple cpus available, call the
    2nd b2 with -j<N>, where <N> is the number of cpus):

    $ ./bootstrap.h --prefix=/path/to/install/boost
    $ ./b2 --build-type=complete --layout=tagged threading=single,multi variant=release
    $ ./b2 install

    If you have compiled boost by yourself, you have to tell the
    dlvhex configure script where you have installed it with

    $ ./configure --with-boost=/path/to/boost-prefix
*** libcurl
    libcurl is a multi-protocol file transfer library. dlvhex uses it
    to retrieve programs specified by http-scheme URLs. This library
    is standard for most operating systems (see
    <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/> for source packages).

    Debian/Ubuntu provides packages called libcurl-dev,
    libcurlN-openssl-dev, and libcurlN-gnutls-dev (or libcurlN-dev)
    for some N; install one of these and you will be able to compile
    dlvhex.

** Configuration
   Run `configure' to create the necessary Makefiles. As usual, use
   the --prefix switch to specify a custom installation
   location. dlvhex uses pkg-config to share build-related
   configuration with plugins. So if you also intend to compile
   plugins and use a custom prefix for dlvhex, make sure to adjust the
   PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable appropriately, otherwise the
   configuration of the plugins will not work. E.g., if your prefix is
   /usr/local (the default), then PKG_CONFIG_PATH needs to be set to
   /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig like this:

   $ ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

   If you installed boost in a non-standard folder, add
   `--with-boost=/path/to/boost-prefix' to the configure switches to
   specify the location of the header files (see above).

   If you compile with special model building libraries, consult the
   section Dependencies above for configuring dlvhex.
   
   If `configure' complains, then something vital for building dlvhex is
   missing in your system. If you get complaints about missing
   boost-headers, make sure that you have the necesary parts of boost
   installed and that their version is sufficiently recent (see
   Dependencies above).

** Documentation
   Run `make doxygen-doc' to create the html documentation (a
   subdirectory `doc' will be created). By default, only the html-docs
   will be built. To enable other formats, you have to give additional
   configure-switches, e.g., by calling

   $ ./configure --enable-doxygen-pdf [...]

   you get a pdf-version of the documentation.

** Testing
   Run `make check' to build and execute the cppunit-based regression
   testsuite. Note that the testsuite is only being built if cppunit
   is installed.

** Installation
   Run `make install' to install the binary dlvhex, its libraries and the
   corresponding header files, which are needed for developing plugins.
   Sometimes it is necessary to run
   
   $ sudo ldconfig

   after the first installation to refresh the shared library cache.

* Running dlvhex
  Using dlvhex is very similar to working with the answer-set solver
  dlv. `dlvhex --help' displays a short help with available
  command-line parameters. For an introduction how to write
  HEX-programs, see the documentation provided at
  <http://http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/systems/dlvhex/> or look
  at the `examples' directory here. DLV programs are described at
  <http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/dlv/#docs>.
	
* Implementing your own plugins and external computations
  For documentation on plugin writing, please consult the doxygen
  documentation in header files include/dlvhex2/PluginInterface.h and
  include/dlvhex2/ComfortPluginInterface.h. You might also want to have a
  look at testsuite/TestPlugin.cpp, the internal plugins of dlvhex
  (classes QueryPlugin, StrongNegationPlugin, and HigherOrderPlugin) and
  existing plugins like dlvhex-stringplugin and dlvhex-scriptplugin in the
  same repository as dlvhex.
