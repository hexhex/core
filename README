DLVHEX Core
===========

This file provides some hints how to install and run dlvhex.

* You just want to use the binary
  We provide pre-compiled Debian/Ubuntu packages of dlvhex and its
  plugins at <https://launchpad.net/~tkren/+archive/asp>. Just run

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tkren/asp

  and then you can install dlvhex and the plugins using your favorite
  package management tool.

* You want to build and install from source
  dlvhex uses the standard

  $ ./configure && make && make install

  approach for installation. In any case, you probably need to install
  additional packages to satisfy all required software dependencies.

** Dependencies
*** libgringo / libclasp (shipped with this package, default)
    If you just run ./configure without extra parameters, it will unpack
    gringo and clasp which is contained in this package, and build it and
    configure dlvhex to use it as solver engine (if dlv is present, both
    can be used with the --solver argument).

    This uses gringo and clasp as genuine grounder resp. solver for hex.

    If something fails, see the following information.

    You can also use the script checkout_build_potassco.sh in this package
    to prepare gringo and clasp libraries to be used by dlvhex.

    Use the configure option
    `--with-libgringo=<gringo-trunk-dir>' resp.
    `--with-libclasp=<clasp-trunk-dir>' to specify the directory
    where you have built clingo-app resp. clasp.app.

    IMPORTANT:
    - use the same boost library as dlvhex, 1.43 works for us
    - you might need to hack CMakeLists.txt to accept your boost version
    - CMakeLists.txt should be modified to force the usage of multithreaded boost
      (change OFF to ON in the respective line) because dlvhex requires multithreaded boost libraries

*** DLV (optional)
    dlvhex uses the answer-set solver DLV, which can be downloaded
    from <http://www.dlvsystem.com/>. Put the downloaded binary in
    your path so that it is executable on your system (don't forget to
    "chmod +x" it!).  dlvhex is looking for `dlv', so you might want
    to rename the downloaded binary or create a softlink to it.

*** libclingo (optional)
    Alternatively, you can use libclingo as background model
    builder. Use the configure option
    `--with-libclingo=<gringo-trunk-dir>' to specify the directory
    where you have built clingo-app.

    How to build a working clingo-app:
    - checkout 3.0.4 tag of gringo
      $ svn co https://potassco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/potassco/tags/gringo-3.0.4
      $ cd gringo-3.0.4
    - create release directory
      $ mkdir -p build/release
    - cmake (specify your boost root)
      $ BOOST_ROOT=<yourboost> cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-Wall -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
    - make (specify your boost root)
      $ BOOST_ROOT=<yourboost> make clingo-app

    Now configure dlvhex with

    $ ./configure --with-libclingo=/path/to/gringo-3.0.4

    IMPORTANT:
    - use the same boost library as dlvhex, 1.43 works for us
    - you might need to hack CMakeLists.txt to accept your boost version

    There is also a script which does everything automatically: checkout_build_potassco.sh
*** DLVDB
    currently unsupported
*** libdlv
    currently unsupported
*** boost
    Boost is a collection of portable C++ source libraries, which are
    intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum
    of applications. You will need a version >= 1.43. See
    <http://www.boost.org/>.

    dlvhex needs the following Boost libraries:
    Boost.Graph
    Boost.Iostreams
    Boost.Smart_Ptr
    Boost.Spirit
    Boost.String_Algo
    Boost.Tokenizer
    Boost.Thread
    Boost.UnitTestFramework

    Popular Linux and Unix distributions such as Fedora, Debian, and
    NetBSD include pre-built Boost packages. E.g., in Debian/Ubuntu
    just run

    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

    or

    $ sudo apt-get install libboostN.NN-all-dev

    for boost version N.NN.

    If your Debian/Ubuntu system did not provide recent boost
    packages, have a look at
    <https://launchpad.net/~boost-latest/+archive/ppa>.

    Installation instructions are given in the INSTALL file found in
    the boost distributions tarball. In order to install
    boost-iostream, install libbz2-dev. Here is a quick-start guide
    for compiling boost (if you have multiple cpus available, call the
    2nd b2 with -j<N>, where <N> is the number of cpus):

    $ ./bootstrap.h --prefix=/path/to/install/boost
    $ ./b2 --build-type=complete --layout=tagged threading=single,multi variant=release
    $ ./b2 install --layout=tagged

    If you have compiled boost by yourself, you have to tell the
    dlvhex configure script where you have installed it with

    $ ./configure --with-boost=/path/to/boost-prefix

*** libcurl
    libcurl is a multi-protocol file transfer library. dlvhex uses it
    to retrieve programs specified by http-scheme URLs. This library
    is standard for most operating systems (see
    <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/> for source packages).

    Debian/Ubuntu provides packages called libcurl-dev,
    libcurlN-openssl-dev, and libcurlN-gnutls-dev (or libcurlN-dev)
    for some N; install one of these and you will be able to compile
    dlvhex.

*** owlcpp
    This library is necessary for repair answer set computation
    (option --repair). To link the library, use one of the
    following options:

    1.
       ./configure --with-owlcpp=PATH
    where PATH points to the main directory of an owlcpp build.
    In this case, make sure that owlcpp and the core are built
    using the same version of boost. Moreover, make sure that
    owlcpp exports all symbols such that they can be used from
    shared libraries; this can be achieved by
    editing the file jamroot.jam in the owlcpp directory such that
    "-fvisibility=hidden" is replaced by "-fvisibility=default" and
    "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden" is removed.
    
    2.
       ./configure --with-owlcpp=auto
   to download and build owlcpp and its dependencies automatically
   as part of the dlvhex build process (internet connection required).

   If dlvhex is built without --with-owlcpp, no support for ontologies
   will be compiled into the binary and --repair is not available.

** Configuration
   Run `configure' to create the necessary Makefiles. As usual, use
   the --prefix switch to specify a custom installation
   location. dlvhex uses pkg-config to share build-related
   configuration with plugins. So if you also intend to compile
   plugins and use a custom prefix for dlvhex, make sure to adjust the
   PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable appropriately, otherwise the
   configuration of the plugins will not work. E.g., if your prefix is
   /usr/local (the default), then PKG_CONFIG_PATH needs to be set to
   /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig like this:

   $ ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

   If you installed boost in a non-standard folder, add
   `--with-boost=/path/to/boost-prefix' to the configure switches to
   specify the location of the header files (see above).

   If you compile with special model building libraries, consult the
   section Dependencies above for configuring dlvhex.
   
   If `configure' complains, then something vital for building dlvhex is
   missing in your system. If you get complaints about missing
   boost-headers, make sure that you have the necesary parts of boost
   installed and that their version is sufficiently recent (see
   Dependencies above).
   
   On Apple OS X, it is recommended to use GNU CC instead of the compiler
   shipped with OS X. Moreover, you will need to install the GNU tools
   cmake, wget, automake and pkgconfig. For this, before starting with the
   installation procedure described above, install
   MacPorts (http://www.macports.org) and type

   sudo port install cmake wget automake gcc47 pkgconfig
   sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc47

** Documentation
   Run `make doxygen-doc' to create the html documentation (a
   subdirectory `doc' will be created). By default, only the html-docs
   will be built. To enable other formats, you have to give additional
   configure-switches, e.g., by calling

   $ ./configure --enable-doxygen-pdf [...]

   you get a pdf-version of the documentation.

** Testing
   Run `make check' to build and execute the cppunit-based regression
   testsuite. Note that the testsuite is only being built if cppunit
   is installed.

** Installation
   Run `make install' to install the binary dlvhex, its libraries and the
   corresponding header files, which are needed for developing plugins.
   Sometimes it is necessary to run
   
   $ sudo ldconfig

   after the first installation to refresh the shared library cache.

* Running dlvhex
  Using dlvhex is very similar to working with the answer-set solver
  dlv. `dlvhex --help' displays a short help with available
  command-line parameters. For an introduction how to write
  HEX-programs, see the documentation provided at
  <http://http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/systems/dlvhex/> or look
  at the `examples' directory here. DLV programs are described at
  <http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/dlv/#docs>.
	
* Implementing your own plugins and external computations
  For documentation on plugin writing, please consult the doxygen
  documentation in header files include/dlvhex2/PluginInterface.h and
  include/dlvhex2/ComfortPluginInterface.h. You might also want to have a
  look at testsuite/TestPlugin.cpp, the internal plugins of dlvhex
  (classes QueryPlugin, StrongNegationPlugin, and HigherOrderPlugin) and
  existing plugins like dlvhex-stringplugin and dlvhex-scriptplugin in the
  same repository as dlvhex.
