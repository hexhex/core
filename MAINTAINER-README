* Building, installing and testing dlvhex-dlplugin

** Prerequisites

See README for all the basic tools and libraries needed in order to
build dlvhex.

The development tools include:

*** flex + bison
dlvhex uses relatively new features of flex and bison, so install the
newest versions of these tools. dlvhex was tested with flex 2.5.33 and
bison 2.3. For installation instruction see the corresponding INSTALL
files of the source packages.

*** autotools
The autotools include autoconf, automake, and libtool. See the
installation instructions of the corresponding packages.


** Configuration

The `configure' script is being built using the `bootstrap.sh'
script. After its execution, follow the configuration instructions in
the README file.

*** bootstrap.sh
Generates Makefile.in's and the `configure' script with help of the
autotools.

*** Build and compiler flags
You can either globally or locally setup the compiler and compiler
flags. For a package-wide setup set CXX and CXXFLAGS during the
`configure' execution. If you want to do a build with another compiler
or other compiler-flags, set CXX and CXXFLAGS in the `make' run.

**** CXX
Set this variable to the C++ compiler you want to use to build
dlvhex. You can also use this variable to set some compiler frontends
such as `ccache' or `distcc'.

**** CXXFLAGS
Add `-O2' and `-W -Wall' for a descent performance boost and warning
output. For even more pedantic compiler warnings, add `-Weffc++'.


** Build

Invoke `make' to build the engine and the API libraries.

** Installation

Invoke `make install'.


** Testsuite

Execute `make check' to build an run the testsuite. Note that the
testsuite depends on the cppunit library (see also README).


** Cleanup

To clean a build, you can choose from a bunch of cleanup targets of
the automatically generated Makefiles:

*** make clean
Removes everything which has been build using `make', but does not
remove the generated flex scanner and bison parser source code.

*** make maintainer-clean-generic
Removes the flex scanner and bison parser.

*** make distclean
This target removes the compiled objects and generated Makefiles from
the build directory. After that, you have to call `configure' again.

*** make maintainer-clean
This target removes almost everything in the build directory.


* Distributing the plugin

There are two make targets which take care of creating a dlvhex source
package:

** make distcheck
Creates a tarball called dlvhex-VERSION.tar.gz, configures, builds and
invokes the testsuite. Afterwards it runs some checks on the fresh
package. This is the prefered way for creating a package.

** make dist
Creates the package dlvhex-VERSION.tar.gz.
