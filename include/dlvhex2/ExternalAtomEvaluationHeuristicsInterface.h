         * To this end, external atoms hold watches on the atoms. The number of such watches is controlled by this method.

         * it is called whenever any relevant atom changes. This might allow for earlier propagation (by nogood learning),
         * but causes more overhead.
         *
         * As a rule of thumb, heuristics which mostly decide to evaluate external atoms might want to further increase the evaluation frequency
         * by returning true, while heuristics which mostly decide not to evaluate external atoms usually return false to avoid overhead.
